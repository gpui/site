## Examples

As we are still in the early days of public gpui, examples are early and few, and those that exist are likely to be broken. However, we are working on it, and we hope to have a few examples soon. Until then, [Zed](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/) will continue to be the best place to see how gpui works.

Additionally, below we've added some community examples and videos that you might find useful.
